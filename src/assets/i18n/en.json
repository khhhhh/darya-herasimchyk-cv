   "I practically live aesthetics and try to find it in everything, as well as create it. During my university studies I learned the basics of many traditional techniques of graphics, graphic design, composition, lettering and typography. In my free time I am fond of almost everything that belongs to the concept of 'creativity': photography, sketching, styling clothes, felting and so on. I have well-developed creativity and a sense of aesthetics. I work in programs such as: Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Figma. I know Russian and Belarusian as native languages, Polish at a good level and English enough to communicate."
